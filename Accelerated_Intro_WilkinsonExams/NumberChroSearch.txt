AT1G28300	CS3868	Embryo lethal, embryos not viviparous, cotyledons partially transformed into leaves, complex vascular pattern observed in cotyledons. Embryos are sensitive to abscisic acid. Mutant seeds were usually desiccation tolerant at maturity, although their viability was reduced slightly after several weeks of storage. Dry seeds often germinated to produce seedlings with distorted cotyledons. This defect resulted from degeneration of cotyledon tips prior to germination. Some trichomes form on cotyledons after germination and stomata are found on surface of cotyledons of mutant embryos The cotyledon surface on seedlings produced from dry seeds lacked trichomes (likely because any trichomes initiated during embryogenesis did not survive desiccation). Mutant seeds were consequently highly pigmented at maturity and anthocyanins were especially prominent in the top half of the mutant cotyledons. Mutant embryos do not form root

AT1G70070	ise2-1	Homozygous mutant seeds can germinate in vitro on agar plates containing Murashige and Skoog (MS) salt plus 1% sucrose, although the  growth/developmental rate of the homozygous seedlings was slower compared with that of wild-type seedlings. Whereas wild-type seedlings displayed fully expanded green cotyledons, true leaves and a well-developed root system by 14 d after germination, homozygous seedlings were much smaller and white or pale green in color. Underdeveloped cotyledons emerged from the homozygous seeds but expanded very slowly and sometimes showed bumpy irregular surfaces and occasional anthocyanin expression. Partial greening was observed in ise2 seedlings only after culture for several weeks. Most of the homozygous seedlings developed leaf-like structures that were translucent and contained trichomes. The aerial portions of the homozygous seedlings generally were stunted and thicker and frequently exhibited callus-like structures after extended periods of culture. Mutant seedlings often form stunted inflorescence shoot- and flower-like organs but normal-looking roots and root

AT1G70560	wei8-1 tar2-1	The roots of this mutant show almost no sensitivity to the ethylene precursor ACC, but sensitivity is largely restored by the addition of low levels of IAA (but not tryptophan). ACC-triggered dark-grown apical hook formation is also compromised in this mutant, and it is not restored by the addition of IAA. Root gravitropism is more disrupted in this double mutant than in either single mutant. The mutant plants are shorter than wild type, have reduced venation in their leaves, exhibit reduced apical dominance, and produce abnormal flowers. DR5:GUS expression is also diminished in these double mutants, consistent with a ~50% reduction in IAA levels in these mutants. Root meristematic cells differentiate in this mutant, leading to a loss of the stem cell niche and the cessation of root

AT2G21790	cls8-1	Homozygous cls8-1 plants had crinkled leaves that showed slight yellowing at 4C  (also apparent under normal growth conditions)  Germination and cotyledon development are indistinguishable from wild type (Columbia), however the first developing true leaves appear bleached. Subsequent leaves emerge curled and ?ruffled?, with bleached edges. The rosette leaves expand some become crinkled and show patches of white or pits on the surface. There is often a degree of asymmetry along the axis of the main vein, with one half of the leaf failing to fully expand. The bleaching is localized to the petiole and the base of the leaf, and extends along the edges of the leaf. As they continue to expand, the leaves become greener, although the crinkling remains. Following bolting, the  cauline leaves show similar characteristics to rosette leaves.  Flowers produced by cls8-1 plants can be asymmetrical and the petals crinkled in appearance. Siliques grow  to a normal size, but are slightly pale in colour with patches of white, and exhibit ?pits? like those present on the leaves.  Root

AT3G53020	CS11180	Defects in apical-basal gynoecium patterning (similar to ett and mp mutants). Mutant plant gynoecia had shorter ovaries and longer gynophores than the wild type, but the total length of the gynoecium is normal before pollination. After pollination, the gynoecium of failed to elongate, resulting in shorter siliques which contained arrested seeds, resulting in lower fertility. The stv1-1 ovules had shorter integuments than wild-type ones, and in some extreme cases, the gametophyte was protruding from the integuments. Mutant plants had defects in vascular system and embryo organization, which are also associated with auxin signaling. Most cotyledons in mutant plants had abnormal vascular patterns that were asymmetric and/or disconnected. Cotyledons were occasionally fused or single, indicating that stv1-1 is associated with defects in embryo patterning. Growth was retarded in both aerial and underground parts of stv1-1 mutants, resulting in plants that were smaller overall than the wild type. In stv1-1 root

AT4G24670	wei8-1 tar2-1	The roots of this mutant show almost no sensitivity to the ethylene precursor ACC, but sensitivity is largely restored by the addition of low levels of IAA (but not tryptophan). ACC-triggered dark-grown apical hook formation is also compromised in this mutant, and it is not restored by the addition of IAA. Root gravitropism is more disrupted in this double mutant than in either single mutant. The mutant plants are shorter than wild type, have reduced venation in their leaves, exhibit reduced apical dominance, and produce abnormal flowers. DR5:GUS expression is also diminished in these double mutants, consistent with a ~50% reduction in IAA levels in these mutants. Root meristematic cells differentiate in this mutant, leading to a loss of the stem cell niche and the cessation of root

In developing pollen mother cells, meiotic progression was interrupted at anaphase I, where chromosomes are randomly distributed and some appear fragmented. Normal embryo sac development was disrupted too, compared to the wild type. AtRAD51 gene was accumulated in the inflorescence nuclei of homozygous plants, while it was absent in the inflorescence nuclei in wild type plants. After exposure to gamma-rays, the levels of AtRAD51 was unchanged in the inflorescence nuclei in mutant plants, while in the wild type nuclei AtRAD51 expression was strongly induced. Compared to the wild type, mutant seedlings were hypersensitive to gamma-irradiation, had shorter root
